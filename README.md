# ang_nodejs_app
Employee management Angular app completed according to the requirements provided.

Requirements provided by Paul:
•	Angular 13
•	Nodejs back-end server (Rest API)
•	Read in data (json file, or db) using the REST API, Data can be anything, something that interests you; cars, stocks, sports teams, etc.…
•	Display the data in a card type format.
•	Implement full CRUD
•	Allow you user to click on the card and drag and drop the order of the data.
•	Save the new order, to be recalled the next time the application runs.
•	Code should have unit tests
•	Save work in GitHub

Notes:
•	Upon last run everything worked according to requirements. JSON file was used for database. Type of data is info about employees.
•	Card order persistence implemented with tracking index order value in JSON file.
•	Aint much but it's honest work :)

Things that could have potentially been added to the project:
•	Form input validation.
•	More tests or test which make more practical sense from the point of view of more experienced developer.
